- **Expect the pain:** 
	- If you're about to run 100 km, expect pain. You're not going to feel any pleasures and know what you're signing yourself for. 
	- Anything in life that is valuable, require some level of sacrifices.
- **How do you anything, is How do you everything:**
	- You characters will be shown on how you do anything.
	- Not having you're room tidy says alot about you: 
		- You're lazy
		- You're a procrastinator
		- You're not willing to do the hard things first when the situation arrives
	- Whatever you're doing privately, will show up publicly
		- How you talk reflects your reading and knowledge
		- How you stand and deliver reflects your mental and physical performance
		- How your body looks reflects how you eat
		- You're unwillingness to come on time reflects your lack of appreciation to the valuable time (and to the people who've come before you, and waited for you)
- **Our limits are often self-imposed:**
	- By the time your brain says you're done, you're only 40% done.
- **Always aim high:** 
	- Whatever is your goal, double it.
	- We don't rise to the level of our expectations, but we fall to the level of our training. 
- **Never give your pain a voice:** 
	- Maybe you're thinking "I am too tired", "my legs hurt" and all that. The negative thoughts will be there, but do not speak it. 
	- By the time you speak of it, you're giving it a power to rule over your act. 
	- This principle can apply in different situation in life, if you're thinking about eating an unhealthy food, speak out loud that 'I am not gonna eat it.'
	- When you're running a marathon, say to yourself that you're never gonna get tired!
	- Speaking the words means you're giving them power. Be very careful about the words you're going to speak.
	-  *"Your mouth is your rudder. And the word that you speak guide you."* 
	  **Chadd Wright**
	- If you're feeling dizzy and sleepy, tell yourself: 
	  "I feel outstanding", "I can do this all day"
